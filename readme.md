#### How to setup this bot?

I used Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10, but it should work on other Linux distros too.

Install Nodejs, NPM and MySQL.

Clone app: `git clone https://github.com/fbslo/posh-bot`

`cd posh-bot`

Install modules: `npm install`

Rename config file: `mv config.demo.json config.json`

Edit `config.json`, add Twitter and database credentials.

Start bot with: `node index.js`
